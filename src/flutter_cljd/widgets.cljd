(defn ^w/Widget autofill-group
  "An AutofillScope widget that groups AutofillClients together.

   AutofillClients that share the same closest AutofillGroup ancestor must be built together, and they be will be autofilled together.
   
   AutofillClients within the same AutofillScope are isolated from other input fields during autofill. That is, when an autofillable TextInputClient gains focus, only the AutofillClients within the same AutofillScope will be visible to the autofill service, in the same order as they appear in AutofillScope.autofillClients.
   
   AutofillScope also allows TextInput to redirect autofill values from the platform to the AutofillClient with the given identifier, by calling AutofillScope.getAutofillClient.
   
   An AutofillClient that's not tied to any AutofillScope will only participate in autofill if the autofill is directly triggered by its own TextInputClient.
   
   The AutofillGroup widget only knows about AutofillClients registered to it using the AutofillGroupState.register API. Typically, AutofillGroup will not pick up AutofillClients that are not mounted, for example, an AutofillClient within a Scrollable that has never been scrolled into the viewport. To workaround this problem, ensure clients in the same AutofillGroup are built together.
   
   The topmost AutofillGroup widgets (the ones that are closest to the root widget) can be used to clean up the current autofill context when the current autofill context is no longer relevant.
   
   An autofill context is a collection of input fields that live in the platform's text input plugin. The platform is encouraged to save the user input stored in the current autofill context before the context is destroyed, when TextInput.finishAutofillContext is called with shouldSave set to true.
   
   Currently, there can only be at most one autofill context at any given time. When any input field in an AutofillGroup requests for autofill (which is done automatically when an autofillable EditableText gains focus), the current autofill context will merge the content of that AutofillGroup into itself. When there isn't an existing autofill context, one will be created to hold the newly added input fields from the group.
   
   Once added to an autofill context, an input field will stay in the context until the context is destroyed. To prevent leaks, call TextInput.finishAutofillContext to signal the text input plugin that the user has finalized their input in the current autofill context. The platform text input plugin either encourages or discourages the platform from saving the user input based on the value of the shouldSave parameter. The platform usually shows a \"Save for autofill?\" prompt for user confirmation.
   
   By default, onDisposeAction is set to AutofillContextAction.commit, in which case when any of the topmost AutofillGroups is being disposed, the platform will be informed to save the user input from the current autofill context, then the current autofill context will be destroyed, to free resources. You can, for example, wrap a route that contains a Form full of autofillable input fields in an AutofillGroup, so the user input of the Form can be saved for future autofill by the platform.

(defn ^w/Widget keep-alive
  "Mark a child as needing to stay alive even when it's in a lazy list that would otherwise remove it.

   This widget is for use in a RenderAbstractViewports, such as Viewport or TwoDimensionalViewport.
   
   This widget is rarely used directly. The SliverChildBuilderDelegate and SliverChildListDelegate delegates, used with SliverList and SliverGrid, as well as the scroll view counterparts ListView and GridView, have an addAutomaticKeepAlives feature, which is enabled by default, and which causes AutomaticKeepAlive widgets to be inserted around each child, causing KeepAlive widgets to be automatically added and configured in response to KeepAliveNotifications.
   
   The same addAutomaticKeepAlives feature is supported by the TwoDimensionalChildBuilderDelegate and TwoDimensionalChildListDelegate.
   
   Therefore, to keep a widget alive, it is more common to use those notifications than to directly deal with KeepAlive widgets.
   
   In practice, the simplest way to deal with these notifications is to mix AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin into one's State. See the documentation for that mixin class for details.
   
   You can pass `:auto` as the `alive` argument to use `AutomaticKeepAlive` widget.

    - `:local-offset` - Local coordinates of touch (Offset?)  
    - `:global-offset` - Global coordinates of touch (Offset?)
  
  Styling:
  The Button supports custom styling via the `flutter-cljd.inherited-keys/button-modifier` inherited key, which accepts a function in this format:
  (fn [child button-context] modified-child). 
  You can set the button modifier using the `with-button-modifier` widget.
  
  To avoid unnecessary widget rebuilds, define your modifier functions using `defn` rather than creating anonymous functions inline.
  
  Also button injects `flutter-cljd.inherited-keys/button-context` into its child widget, so you can access the button context in your child widget and use it for custom styling or other purposes.

  Examples:
  
  ```clojure
  (->> (text \"Click me!\")
       (button #(print \"Button clicked!\")))
    
  (->> (text \"Interact with me\")
     (button {:on-tap #(print \"Button clicked!\")

   This container will then attempt to adopt the same size, within the limits of its own constraints.
   If it ends up with a different size, it will align the child based on alignment.
   If the container cannot expand enough to accommodate the entire child, the child will be clipped if `:clip` is not `:none`.

   In debug mode, if `:clip` is `:none` and the child overflows the container, a warning will be printed on the console, and black and yellow striped areas will appear where the overflow occurs.

   When child is nil, this widget becomes as small as possible and never overflows.

   This widget can be used to ensure some of child's natural dimensions are honored, and get an early warning otherwise during development.
   For instance, if child requires a minimum height to fully display its content, `:transform` can be set to `maxHeightUnconstrained`,
   so that if the parent `RenderObject` fails to provide enough vertical space, a warning will be displayed in debug mode, while still allowing child to grow vertically

   the flexibility to expand to fill the available space in the main axis (e.g., horizontally for a `row` or vertically for a `column`), but, 
   unlike `expanded`, `flexible` does not require the child to fill the available space.
   
   Args:
    - `:flex` (number, default: 1): The flex factor to use for this child.
    - `:fit` (FlexFit, default: `:loose`): How the child is inscribed into the available space.
      Possible values: `:tight`, `:loose`.
    - `child`: The child widget to be flexed.

   A `flexible` widget must be a descendant of a `row`, `column`, or `flex`, and the path from the `flexible` widget to its enclosing `row`, `column` or `flex` must contain only `StatelessWidget`s or `StatefulWidget`s (not other kinds of widgets, like `RenderObjectWidget`s)."

(defn ^w/Widget row
  "A widget that displays its children in a horizontal array.

   To cause a child to expand to fill the available horizontal space, wrap the child in an Expanded widget.

   The Row widget does not scroll (and in general it is considered an error to have more children in a Row than will fit in the available room).
   If you have a line of widgets and want them to be able to scroll if there is insufficient room, consider using a ListView.

   For a vertical variant, see `column`.

   If you only have one child, then consider using Align or Center to position the child.

   By default, `:cross-axis-alignment` is `:center`, which centers the children in the vertical axis. If several of the children contain text, this is likely to make them visually misaligned if they have different font metrics (for example because they differ in TextStyle.fontSize or other TextStyle properties, or because they use different fonts due to being written in different scripts). Consider using `:cross-axis-alignment` `:baseline` instead.
   
   Args:
    - `:key` An identifier for the row.
    - `:spacing` (number, default: 0): The spacing between each child widget.
    - `:main-axis-alignment` (keyword or MainAxisAlignment, default: `:start`): The alignment of the children along the main axis.
      Possible values: `:center`, `:start`, `:end`, `:space-between`, `:space-around`, `:space-evenly`.
    - `:main-axis-size` (keyword or MainAxisSize, default: :min): The size of the row in the main axis.
      Possible values: :max, :min.
    - `:cross-axis-alignment` (keyword or CrossAxisAlignment, default: `:center`): The alignment of the children along the cross axis.
      Possible values: `:center`, `:start`, `:end`, `:stretch`, `:baseline`.
    - `:text-direction` (keyword or TextDirection, default: `:ltr`): The direction of the text.
      Possible values: `:ltr`, `:rtl`.
    - `:text-baseline` (keyword or TextBaseline, default: `:alphabetic`): The baseline alignment for the text.
      Possible values: `:alphabetic`, `:ideographic`.

(defn ^w/Widget animated
  "Animates values and rebuilds its subtree on every tick.

   General form: `(animated [opts?] builder values... [child?])`.
   To animate a modifier, wrap it with `animated`:

   ```
   (padding pd child)  ; static
   (animated padding pd child)  ; animated — just insert `animated` before the call
   ```

   ## Implicit

   Animates automatically when values change.
   An options map can be passed as the first argument:

   ```clojure
   (->> (some-widget)
     (animated padding pd)
     (animated offset :dx x-offset) 
     (animated {:duration 200} decorated {:color clr}))

   ;; Standalone builder
   (animated #(text \"Hello\" {:color %}) color)

   ;; Multiple values
   (animated
     {:duration 250}
     #(padding (:padding %) (text \"Text\" {:color (:color %)}))
     {:padding pd :color txt-clr})
   ```

   ## Explicit

   Driven by an `Animation`, `ValueListenable`, or `Atom`:

   ```clojure
   ;; Modifier in a pipeline
   (->> (text \"Hello\")
     (animated controller opacity))

   ;; For composite values, ILookup on Animation extracts a child animation
   (->> (text \"Hello\")
     (animated (:opacity controller) opacity)
     (animated (:offset controller) offset :dx))

   ;; Standalone builder
   (animated my-animation #(opacity % (text \"Fade\")))
   ```

   ## Child widget

   Both modes accept an optional child widget as the last argument.
   When present, the builder acts as a modifier — it wraps the child
   without rebuilding it on each tick. In a `->>` pipeline the child
   is threaded automatically.

   Extra static args are passed to the modifier as-is;
   the animated value is appended as the last arg before child:
   `(animated controller offset :dx)` → `(offset :dx animated-value child)`.

   ## Options (implicit mode only)

   | Key                | Default            | Description                          |
   |--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
   | `:duration`        | 250 ms             | Animation duration                   |
   | `:curve`           | `Curves.easeInOut` | Animation curve                      |
   | `:lerp`            | `utils/lerp`       | Interpolation function               |
   | `:on-end`          | nil                | Callback when animation completes    |
   | `:when`            | true               | Condition that enables the animation |
   | `:update-strategy` | `:immediate`       | How mid-animation updates are handled (see below) |

   `:update-strategy` values:
     - `:immediate` — restart toward the new target immediately.
     - `:on-complete` — finish current animation, then animate to the latest target.
     - `:sequential` — finish current animation, then replay every queued target in order.

   ## Animatable values

   Numbers, vectors, maps, and Flutter classes with a static `lerp` method
   (e.g. `Color`, `Alignment`).

   Values must stay structurally consistent between updates:

   ```clojure
   ;; Bad — different map keys, can't interpolate
   {:h 8 :v 10} -> {:all 16}

   ;; Good — both are EdgeInsets instances
   (t/insets {:h 8 :v 10}) -> (t/insets {:all 16})
   ```

   Keywords are not animatable — convert with `t/color`, `t/alignment`, etc."
